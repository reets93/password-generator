# <Password Generator>

## Description

Using javascript, I created a random password generator, which would generate passwords based on the inputted criteria. 
I used functions to get random elements from the different character types and then created loops to repeat a random selection or previously randomly selected elements to the chosen password length. 

## Usage
Click on the 'Generate Password' button. Answer the questions to enter your password criteria. See the screen for your password.
